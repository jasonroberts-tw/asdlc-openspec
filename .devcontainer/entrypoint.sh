# The three setup steps that cannot be image layers, because each one reads the repository and the
# repository is a bind mount that does not exist at build time:
#
#   1. `npm ci`                   -- node_modules holds native binaries, so it belongs to the
#                                    container's platform, not the host's. This is also why
#                                    README.md tells people never to share a clone between Windows
#                                    and WSL.
#   2. the git hooks              -- the five `hook.asdlc-*` entries in the repository's config,
#                                    which run scripts/git-hooks.mjs at each event.
#   3. the beads issue database   -- a Dolt DB under .beads/embeddeddolt/, not in git.
#
# ...a warning when the image's tools lag `mise.toml`, since it installs none, and a warning when Vale
# cannot load `.vale.ini`. Its styles are what `vale sync` downloads into the
# repository, once, and a person runs it (.devcontainer/README.md): this script does not...
#
# ...and a check that the agents' GitHub App, as which the container's `git` and `gh` act, can mint
# a token, which is here for the same reason: it depends on the key devcontainer.json mounts from
# the host, which is unknown at build time. With it, the App's bot account set as git's commit
# identity when none is, read from the clone's policy, which the image cannot see either.
#
# ...and the two Claude Code plugins .claude/settings.json enables, beads@beads-marketplace and
# vale@agent-tools, for both reasons: the marketplaces they come from are registered in the
# container's own ~/.claude, a volume, and a project-scope install record names the clone's path, a
# bind mount.
#
# Wired to ENTRYPOINT by the Dockerfile so that devcontainer.json needs no lifecycle command. Runs
# on every container start, which is why every step below is idempotent and cheap when there is
# nothing to do.
#
# Nothing here is allowed to fail the container. This is the process that starts the shell you would
# use to fix a setup problem; exiting non-zero would lock you out of it. Every step warns and
# carries on.
