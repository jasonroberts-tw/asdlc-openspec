name: root-cause
description: Find why a gate, test, proof or CI job fails, or why a tool misbehaves, before anything is changed to fix it - reproduce it alone, read before guessing, test one hypothesis at a time, see a case fail before the fix, and stop after rootCauseMaxFixes fixes that failed. Use whenever a failure's cause is not yet known, before the first fix.

Read CLAUDE.md first. Everything below is subordinate to it and points at it rather than restating it.

# Find the cause before the fix

Nothing is changed to fix a failure until its cause is found: a fix aimed at a guess can turn the
check green and leave the cause in place, where the next run meets it with less to go on.

## 1. Reproduce it alone

Run the failing command as a call of its own, as `CLAUDE.md` § Bash command style says: what it
prints is what each later run is compared with. A failure that does not reproduce is reported as not
reproduced, with the command and what it printed, never as fixed: nothing changed, so nothing was
fixed.

## 2. Read before guessing

- **The whole error.** The first error printed is often the cause, and what follows its fallout.
- **The failing gate's header.** Its second part names the failure the gate exists to prevent
  (`CLAUDE.md` § Standing rules for prompts and gates), often the one in front of you.
- **What changed since its last green run:** the commits since (`git log`), a rebase's new commits
  from `origin/main`, the lockfile, `mise.toml`, and the environment, such as a variable or a
  tool's version.

Where the failure crosses components, such as a CI job running a task that runs a script, first
find the boundary it breaks at: print once what enters and leaves each.

## 3. One hypothesis at a time

Write each as a cause and the reason to suspect it, with the observation that would refute it.
Test it with the smallest probe that could, a command that reads rather than an edit that fixes,
and test one at a time: two changed together cannot say which mattered.

Record each hypothesis refuted, with its probe and what that showed, with `bd note` on the issue
the work runs on, or in the pull request's description where none does, so no later session tests
it again.

## 4. The cause an issue states is a hypothesis too

So is a cause a title, a brief or an earlier session's note names: test it as § 3 says before
building on it (`CLAUDE.md` § Verification before claiming).

## 5. Prove it, then fix it

Once a hypothesis holds, write the test or selftest case that reproduces the failure and see it
fail before the fix, as `.claude/skills/bead/SKILL.md` § 4 says; then fix the cause. Never change
the check that reports it to agree, which bypasses it (the same section); when the cause is in the
check itself, the check is the defect, and its selftest case is the one seen to fail. A cause
outside the repository, such as a service's setting or the container's image, has no case to fail:
its evidence goes where § 3 records a hypothesis, and its fix where it lives.

## 6. Stop after `rootCauseMaxFixes` fixes that failed

A fix failed when the failure is still there once it is made, or is gone and something else broke.
After `rootCauseMaxFixes` of them (`tools/policy/agent-workflows.json`), make no further fix: report
to the user each hypothesis tested, what refuted or confirmed it, and each fix made and what it
did. Fixes that each uncover a new failure elsewhere say the design may be what is wrong, which
is the user's call. With no user, the report goes where § 3 records a hypothesis, and the issue stays open.
