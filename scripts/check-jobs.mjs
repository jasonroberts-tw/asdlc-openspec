/**
 * Job-to-script cross-check gate: the hooks and CI invoke only scripts that exist, and every script
 * they do not invoke is of a kind this file declares.
 *
 *   npm run check:jobs             the gate; prints the re-derived breakdown on every run
 *   npm run check:jobs:selftest    its fixtures -- every assertion exercised on a doctored copy
 *
 * THE JOB THIS EXISTS FOR. A `package.json` script is a public name and nothing gates its citations
 * (the add-npm-script skill opens with that sentence). Two failures follow, and both
 * have happened here. A job names a script that was renamed or deleted: the hook or the CI step then
 * fails on the next push for a reason unrelated to the change being pushed, which is how a gate gets
 * passed with `--no-verify`. And a gate-shaped script is defined and invoked by NOTHING: a
 * selftest sat in `package.json` with no job in either file, a regression suite that reported the
 * past, and a `:check` went red for six weeks before anything wired it. The same cross-check, run
 * by hand and quoted in a note, was found false at the next verification. A cross-check quoted in
 * a note measures one commit. This is the gate.
 *
 * WHAT FAILS THE JOB:
 *   1. an `npm run <name>` or `node --run <name>` token in a `run:` of `lefthook.yml` or
 *      `.github/workflows/verify.yml` whose <name> is not a `package.json` script (the hook launches
 *      through `node --run`, CI through `npm run`; both name the same script).
 *      Comment lines are not read -- both files quote scripts they deliberately do NOT run -- and a
 *      multi-line `run: |` block is.
 *   2. a `package.json` script with no `run:` token in either file that `UNJOBBED_BY_KIND` below
 *      does not declare. A gate-shaped one (`check:*`, `*:check`, `*:selftest`, `*:selfcheck`) is
 *      reported as "wire it, or name the exception with its reason"; anything else as "declare its
 *      kind". Either way a new un-jobbed script fails on arrival rather than joining the list.
 *   3. an `UNJOBBED_BY_KIND` entry that names no script, names one twice, names one that HAS a job
 *      (a stale exception is a hole in the gate -- `check-register-status.mjs`'s allowlist rule), or
 *      names one whose spelling contradicts the kind's shape.
 *   4. a script whose command names a `tools/`, `scripts/` or `migration/` path that does not exist
 *      on disk.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CHECKED, deliberately: WHERE a jobbed script runs (pre-push, CI or both) -- that is
 * `pipeline:check`'s question for the graph's regeneration nodes and the README's Gate column for
 * the rest; whether a job's OTHER commands (`git diff`, `npx prettier`, `bd hooks run`) resolve; and
 * the `pre-commit` jobs' `{staged_files}` templates.
 *
 * NEGATIVE TESTING. `--selftest` copies the three files under `os.tmpdir()` and doctors ONE thing
 * per case, asserting the run fails FOR THAT REASON -- plus a control that the undoctored copy
 * passes, without which every other case could be failing on the copy. Path existence is resolved
 * against the real tree in every case, since a copy of three files has no `tools/`. By hand, point
 * `CHECK_JOBS_ROOT` at a copy, as `check-register-status.mjs` does with `CHECK_REGISTER_ROOT`.
 *
 * Reads only committed files; no `../estate` checkout, no network, milliseconds. `pre-push` and
 * CI both, by the add-npm-script skill's step on where a gate runs.
