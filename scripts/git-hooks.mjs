/**
 * The git hook runner. Git's config-based hooks call it, one `hook.asdlc-<event>` entry per event,
 * and it runs that event's jobs from `git-hooks.yml` (`docs/decisions.md` § D-19).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. It reads `git-hooks.yml`, which keeps lefthook's schema, and only the part of it this
 * repository used: hook keys `jobs` and `parallel`; job keys `name`, `run`, `glob`, `env` and
 * `group`; group keys `jobs` and `parallel`; and the `run` tokens `{1}`, `{2}`, `{3}` and
 * `{staged_files}`. It refuses any other key or token, an event it does not install, a glob on an
 * event that has no files, and `{staged_files}` outside pre-commit, so a key copied in from
 * another runner's documentation is refused rather than silently ignored. At pre-commit the files
 * are the staged ones; at pre-push they are the pushed ones, from the lines Git writes to its
 * standard input.
 * A job runs when it has no glob, when one of its globs matches one of those files
 * (`path.matchesGlob`, under which `*` stops at `/`), or when the run is forced. It prints one line
 * per job, the jobs it skipped and why, and a total; a failing job also prints the last
 * `gitHooksFailedOutputBytes` (in `tools/policy/tool-settings.json`) of its output and the path of
 * a file holding all of it.
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT EXISTS TO PREVENT. lefthook ran these jobs until this runner replaced it, and
 * `asdlc-openspec-pp6` lists what that cost, each with its evidence:
 *   - its npm postinstall rewrote the hooks every checkout shares from whichever worktree last ran
 *     `npm ci`: on 2026-10-01 all five shims named the binary of one worktree,
 *     `wf_a32cb9f8-89a-2` (`asdlc-openspec-uc1`, step 0a);
 *   - its install renamed another tool's hook `<hook>.old`, which never runs, and erased a section
 *     appended to its own shim: the tracker's sections the dev container appended on 2025-09-25
 *     survived only as `.backup` copies (the same step);
 *   - its bare run skipped every job and exited 0 when the push changed nothing ("36 jobs
 *     skipped, 0.11s, exit 0");
 *   - `npm run gates` printed 34-108 KB. On 2026-10-01 a run with one failing job printed
 *     110,244 bytes, and the agent's harness cut it mid-run;
 *   - its shim ran the lefthook on PATH before the pinned one: a commit on 2026-10-01 ran
 *     Homebrew's 2.1.14, not the pinned 2.1.12;
 *   - a run by hand saw a different environment from a real push, which once let a selftest pass
 *     by hand and damage the repository under a real push (the header of
 *     `scripts/hooks/worktree-hooks.selftest.mjs`).
 * The wrong fix weighed first was lefthook, hardened: D-19 says what it left. If this runner were
 * wrong, a glob it misread would stop a gate on exactly the pushes that change its inputs, and a
 * skip it did not print would read as a pass; `--selftest` holds both.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER BLOCKS. `git worktree add` runs post-checkout in the new worktree and fails when it
 * fails, and a new worktree has no `node_modules` until `npm ci`. So at prepare-commit-msg,
 * post-checkout and post-merge, which gate nothing, a runner that cannot start (no `js-yaml`, a job
 * file it refuses, an older Git) prints why and exits 0; a job that runs and fails still fails the
 * event. At pre-commit and pre-push the same refusal fails the commit or the push.
 *
 * INVOCATION.
 *   node scripts/git-hooks.mjs <event> [git's arguments]   what each `hook.asdlc-<event>.command` runs
 *   mise run gates           (--gates) the pre-push suite through `git hook run --to-stdin`, forced, with
 *                           the branch's push line, so it sees a real push's environment and input
 *   mise run hooks:install   (--install) writes the five `hook.asdlc-*` entries into the repository's
 *                           own config and removes lefthook's shims from the hooks directory
 *   npm's `prepare`         (--prepare) the install, skipped when `CI` is set; `npm ci` runs it
 *   mise run hooks:selftest  (--selftest) every refusal and every path above, in scratch repositories
 *   GIT_HOOKS_FORCE=1       runs every job, whatever its glob
 *   GIT_HOOKS_SKIP=1        runs none, and says so
 *   GIT_HOOKS_ROOT=<dir>    reads `git-hooks.yml` and `tools/policy/` from a doctored copy, and
 *                           runs its jobs and git there
 *
 * NEEDS. Git 2.54.0 or later, the first that reads `hook.*` (the install and the gates refuse an
 * older one); Node 22.20.0 or later for `path.matchesGlob`, inside the `engines` floor; `js-yaml`
 * from `node_modules`; the policy's loader, `tools/lib/policy.ts`, beside it. No network. The
 * selftest needs `sh` for the cases that fake an old Git or send a signal, and skips them, saying
 * so, on Windows.
