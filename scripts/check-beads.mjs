/**
 * Every bead in the tracker stands on its own: it names where its work lands, an open bead a run
 * filed `discovered-from` another names the kinds of file its work would change, and every
 * identifier it cites resolves from THIS checkout.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT. A bead is a set of instructions an agent executes months
 * after a human wrote it, and the tracker is the only thing that travels with it. When a bead cites
 * an id from another repository's tracker for the rule that justifies the gate it is asking for,
 * that id resolves in a DIFFERENT repository's database, on one developer's laptop. `bd show`
 * errors on it here. The fact does not travel; only a pointer to it does, and the pointer is dead
 * everywhere except the machine it was written on.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. One bead cited a predecessor id, an emitter hard-coded the same id,
 * and it was PUBLISHED into a generated artifact as the stated authority for a hard exclusion
 * rule. The smell escaped the tracker and shipped.
 *
 * AN UNLABELLED FOUND ISSUE IS A HOLE IN A COUNT, AND THE COUNT DOES NOT SHOW IT. `docs/decisions.md`
 * § D-06 retired the run-outcome learning loop and put labels in its place: an issue a run files
 * `discovered-from` the issue it ran on carries a label that `assetLabels` in `tools/policy.json`
 * lists for each kind of file its work would change, so `bd count --by-label` shows what keeps
 * needing a fix (`CLAUDE.md` § The task store). On 2026-09-26 a fan-out sweep's investigator found
 * asdlc-openspec-egt and asdlc-openspec-pkn open with no such label: both were filed
 * `discovered-from` on 2026-09-23, the day before D-06, and nothing had asked for the label since.
 * The count left both out and read the same as a complete one. The sweep labelled them by hand, and
 * rule 4 below refuses the next one.
 *
 * WHY A REGISTRY RATHER THAN A BAN. A bead that CORRECTS a stale foreign citation has to name the
 * id it is correcting, so a flat prohibition would forbid the fix along with the defect. This is the
 * same trade `tools/citations/scan.ts` makes with its `QUOTED` list, and the same reasoning: each
 * exemption is registered individually, with a reason, rather than by a wholesale exemption that
 * would stop saying anything.
 *
 * WHY THE LIVE RUN IS NOT A CI STEP, AND ITS SELFTEST IS. The live run reads the Dolt database
 * through `bd export`. CI has neither the database nor the binary, so it would compare against
 * nothing and pass. It is a `pre-push` job. Where `bd` is unavailable it SKIPS CLEAN and says so -- a
 * gate that is red on every fresh clone gets bypassed with `--no-verify`, which costs you every other
 * gate too. `--selftest` reads only the fixtures it writes and the committed `tools/policy.json`, and
 * runs no `bd`, so it is a pre-push job and a `.github/workflows/verify.yml` step both
 * (`CLAUDE.md` § The gate ladder).
 *
 * "UNAVAILABLE" MEANS NOT FOUND, AND NOTHING ELSE. `tools/lib/bd-launcher.ts` resolves `bd` on PATH
 * and starts it without a shell; only its `found: false` answer is a skip. A `bd` that IS found and
 * then cannot be started, exits non-zero, or writes nothing is a FAILURE, printed with the launcher
 * and the spawn error, because the mirror of the paragraph above happened: on native Windows `bd` is
 * the npm shim `%APPDATA%\npm\bd`, `execFileSync('bd')` threw ENOENT on it, and this gate reported
 * "skipped" over a tracker that `bd export` in the same shell had just written 107 issues from.
 * A green run prints the bead count it read and which `bd` it read
 * through, so it cannot be mistaken for the skip in a pre-push log.
 *
 * FOUR HARD FAILURES:
 *
 *   1. An unregistered id carrying PREDECESSOR_PREFIX in any bead field: an id from the predecessor
 *      repository's tracker. Register it below with a reason, or copy the fact in. With no
 *      predecessor, PREDECESSOR_PREFIX stays null and this rule goes.
 *   2. An open bead with no `repo:` label. A bead that does not say where its work lands is not
 *      self-describing, and the reader has to guess which checkout it means.
 *   3. A bead whose work lands in a foreign repository and which does not cite its context bead.
 *      Those beads carry the copied bundle facts; a cross-repo bead that does not point at one is
 *      asking the reader to go and open another checkout.
 *   4. An open bead with a `discovered-from` dependency and no label that `assetLabels` in
 *      `tools/policy.json` lists. The list is read from the policy on every run and spelled nowhere
 *      here, so a label added there is accepted at once, and a label renamed there strands every
 *      issue that carries the old spelling, as `assetLabelsMeans` warns. A closed bead is exempt:
 *      the count is read for what is still to fix. A policy with no such list, or an empty one, is a
 *      failure, never a pass over nothing.
 *
 * "Open" is every status but `closed`, for rules 2 to 4. Plus one consistency check: a context bead
 * cited by rule 3 must itself exist in the export, so this gate cannot be satisfied by pointing at an
 * id that is as dead as the ones it forbids.
 *
 * INVOCATION.
 *
 *   npm run beads:check                         the gate, over what `bd export` writes
 *   npm run beads:selftest                      its refusals over a fixture export (--selftest)
 *   BEADS_CHECK_ROOT=<dir> npm run beads:check  the gate over a doctored copy
 *
 * ROOT OVERRIDE. `BEADS_CHECK_ROOT` names a doctored copy: a directory holding `tools/policy.json` and
 * `export.jsonl`, one issue per line in the shape `bd export` writes. The gate then reads both from
 * there and runs no `bd`. A copy with no export is a failure, never a fall-back to the live tracker
 * or a skip.
 *
 * NEGATIVE TESTING. `--selftest` writes a fixture export and a copy of the committed policy under
 * `os.tmpdir()`, doctors ONE thing per case, runs this gate on it as a child process through
 * `BEADS_CHECK_ROOT`, and asserts the run fails FOR THAT REASON. Its undoctored control must pass and
 * must print the fixture's bead count and the override, so neither a skip nor a read of the live
 * tracker can pass for it. Rules 1 and 3 have nothing configured yet (PREDECESSOR_PREFIX is null and
 * CONTEXT_BEAD is empty), so no case breaks them; the case for each lands with its first entry.
 * Nine gate runs, one Node process each: 0.63-0.64 s wall through `node --run` (`/usr/bin/time -p`,
 * two runs) on a macOS 26.7 laptop (Apple M3 Max) with Node 26.8.1, 2026-09-26.
 *
 * NEEDS `bd` on PATH for the live run, and skips clean without it. The override and the selftest
 * need nothing but Node: no `bd`, no network.
