# Creates one isolated worktree per agent task: a branch off origin/main, a checked pair of
# ports, and a rendered .worktree/CONTEXT.md briefing that the committed CLAUDE.md @-imports.
#
# There is no database, container stack or .env to provision -- this repository is a Node/TypeScript
# toolchain whose one server is the calculator demo's, which a person starts by hand. An earlier
# version of this script copied .env, certs and appsettings.Development.json and wrote
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME/DB_NAME/DB_PORT into .env; none of those files or services exist here, so
# every line of it was inert. The port pair is reserved so that two worktrees never collide: the
# first is the PORT to give `npm run calculator:serve` there (docs/decisions.md § D-04), the second
# is unused. scripts/render-worktree-context.mjs owns the pair.
#
# It also does not install dependencies. node_modules is gitignored and platform-native, so the new
# checkout has none; `npm ci` is the first command inside the worktree, and both the summary printed
# below and the rendered briefing say so.
#
# Run from the primary checkout.

# Two calling conventions. `<task-ref> <slug>` is the orchestrator's, and the one the briefing's
# prose is written around. The single-argument form takes an already-composed name, and exists for
# scripts/hooks/worktree-create.mjs: the harness hands that hook one opaque worktree name with no way
# to split it back into a bead ref and a slug. Both forms land on the same NAME, so there is one code
# path below and no second way for a worktree to get provisioned.
