# Creates one isolated worktree per agent task: a branch off origin/main, a checked pair of
# ports, a rendered .worktree/CONTEXT.md briefing that the committed CLAUDE.md @-imports, and a copy
# of each of the primary checkout's Vale styles the worktree lacks: the synced ones, which git
# ignores (the block that copies them says why).
#
# There is no database, container stack or .env to provision -- this repository is a Node/TypeScript
# toolchain whose one server is the calculator demo's, which a person starts by hand. An earlier
# version of this script copied .env, certs and appsettings.Development.json and wrote
# COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME/DB_NAME/DB_PORT into .env; none of those files or services exist here, so
# every line of it was inert. The port pair is reserved so that two worktrees never collide: the
# first is the PORT to give `npm run calculator:serve` there (docs/decisions.md § D-04), the second
# is unused. scripts/render-worktree-context.mjs owns the pair.
#
# It also does not install dependencies. node_modules is gitignored and platform-native, so the new
# checkout has none; `npm ci` is the first command inside the worktree, and both the summary printed
# below and the rendered briefing say so.
#
# Several runs at once, as a fan-out sweep starts them, do not fail one another: no run writes the
# shared .git/config, and a run that fails deletes the branch it made, and only that one
# (asdlc-openspec-686; the block that cuts the branch has the incident).
#
# Run from the primary checkout.

# to split it back into a bead ref and a slug. Both forms land on the same NAME, so there is one code

# The branch is cut with --no-track, and before the worktree, in two steps. On 2026-09-26 a fan-out
# sweep launched eleven lanes at once and two WorktreeCreate hooks failed with "could not lock config
# file .git/config: File exists" (asdlc-openspec-686): `git worktree add -b ... origin/main` set the
# new branch's upstream, a write to the one `.git/config` every worktree shares, and concurrent runs
# race for its lock. On 2026-10-03, 30 concurrent runs of a scratch copy failed 3 times so, and 50 of
# this one none. With --no-track no run writes the config at all, so there is no lock to race for,
# nothing to retry and no serialising lock of this script's own to leave stale; nor the two keys per
# branch that scripts/prune-worktree-branches.mjs then had to collect. The branch needs no upstream:
# the briefing rebases onto origin/main by name, `open-pr`'s `git push -u` sets the pushed branch as
# the upstream, and `npm run gates` reads a branch with none as new, from its merge base with
# origin/main (scripts/git-hooks.mjs). Where it loses: a bare `git pull --rebase` in a worktree not
# yet pushed, which rebased onto origin/main, now stops on git's "no tracking information" until the
# push; `git pull --rebase origin main` names the base. The second step is what lets the trap tell
# its own branch from another's: `git worktree add -b` makes the branch and then fails on an
# occupied path, so its exit status cannot say whether the branch it failed with was its own.

# Vale's styles, copied from the primary checkout. `.vale.ini` names a StylesPath that `.gitignore`
# ignores, because `vale sync` downloads it, so `git worktree add` brings none across. Without this
# copy, the vale@agent-tools plugin's hook answered every Write and Edit in a worktree with "E201: The
# path '<worktree>/.vale-styles' does not exist", a notice that reads like a check that ran, while no
# prose written in a worktree was checked (asdlc-openspec-hv8, seen on 2026-09-30 in two worktrees
# cut at ff2aaad). A copy, and not `vale sync`, because the WorktreeCreate hook runs this where the
# network can be unreachable (the fetch above). And not a symlink: `.gitignore`'s directory rule does
# not ignore one, Git Bash on Windows makes a copy anyway, and an absolute target dangles wherever the
# dev container and the host see the checkout at different paths. The copy is the primary's styles
# at the moment the worktree is cut; a later `vale sync` there reaches a worktree cut after it.
# The path is read from the worktree's own `.vale.ini`, so it is stated once. An absolute or `..`
# path is shared by every checkout already, and is left alone.
#
# Each entry of the primary's StylesPath that the worktree lacks is copied, one by one, so a style the
# base tracks there stays the base's and the synced ones still arrive. The copy once skipped the whole
# directory whenever the worktree had it, and a tracked style, `Layout`, makes it always have it: the
# worktree would get that one style and none of the synced ones `.vale.ini` names, and Vale would load
# no config (asdlc-openspec-m7p). A failed copy warns and carries on: it costs the check, not the
# worktree. Nothing copied is warned of too, since the tracked style alone is not a config Vale loads.
