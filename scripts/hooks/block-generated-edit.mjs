/**
 * PreToolUse hook. Refuses a Write or Edit aimed at a GENERATED file, and says where the change goes.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS, which happened: hand-correcting generated output. A brief that tells the
 * reader to fix what an emitter got wrong invites the fix to land in the file that is wrong. That edit
 * survives until the next run of the emitter, which silently reverts it -- or until the gate that
 * diffs the two, which turns it into a build failure with no memory of what the edit was for.
 *
 * AND A WORKTREE IT DID NOT SEE. Until 2026-10-03 (asdlc-openspec-d2qv) the hook judged every path
 * against its own checkout, which for a session that has entered a worktree is the primary checkout
 * (`.claude/README.md` § The hooks). An edit to a generated file in a linked worktree, where most
 * agent work happens, became `.claude/worktrees/<name>/artifacts/...`, which no redirect matched, and
 * passed; the catch-all skips Markdown, so nothing at all held the trace record's README there. The
 * checkout is now placed by the edited file's own path (`editedCheckout`), never by the payload's
 * `cwd`, which would let a worktree session edit the primary checkout's generated files unrefused.
 *
 * Exit 2 is the documented way for a PreToolUse hook to block; stderr becomes the reason shown to the
 * agent. The reason is not "don't do that" -- it is the list of files the change could legitimately
 * belong to, so the next move is a redirect rather than a guess.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT blocked: the emitters themselves, under `tools/`, which is where fixes go.
 *
 *   node scripts/hooks/block-generated-edit.mjs < payload.json
 *
 * Needs `git`, which places the path: four calls inside a checkout and two outside any. With none on
 * PATH, every path is judged against this hook's own checkout, as before the fix.
 * `gate-summary.selftest.mjs` runs a copy over a scratch repository and its worktrees and prints the
 * hook's wall time.
