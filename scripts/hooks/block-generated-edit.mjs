/**
 * PreToolUse hook. Refuses a Write or Edit aimed at a GENERATED file, and says where the change goes.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS, which happened: hand-correcting generated output. A brief that tells the
 * reader to fix what an emitter got wrong invites the fix to land in the file that is wrong. That edit
 * survives until the next run of the emitter, which silently reverts it -- or until the gate that
 * diffs the two, which turns it into a build failure with no memory of what the edit was for.
 *
 * Exit 2 is the documented way for a PreToolUse hook to block; stderr becomes the reason shown to the
 * agent. The reason is not "don't do that" -- it is the list of files the change could legitimately
 * belong to, so the next move is a redirect rather than a guess.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT blocked: the emitters themselves, which is where fixes go -- `tools/catalogue/`,
 * `tools/outcomes/` and the rest.
