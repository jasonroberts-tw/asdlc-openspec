/**
 * WorktreeRemove hook. The teardown half of scripts/hooks/worktree-create.mjs.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS: worktrees that cannot be removed and so are never removed. Two of them
 * were found registered days after their work had landed, and the reason they survived was not
 * neglect -- `git worktree remove` fails inside the agent sandbox:
 *
 *     error: failed to delete '.git/worktrees/<name>': Device or resource busy
 *
 * The sandbox's bind mounts hold the admin directory open, so the removal an exiting agent attempts
 * cannot succeed, and the same run leaves a read-only `.git/config.lock` behind that then blocks
 * every later `git config` write. Both are worked around below. Without a hook the harness falls
 * back to plain `git worktree remove` and inherits the whole failure.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: delete the branch. `git worktree remove` only ever removes a
 * checkout, and the branch is the work. CLAUDE.md routes a worktree's branch to trunk through a pull
 * request the orchestrator merges, which means the branch outliving its worktree is the normal case,
 * not a leak. Deleting it here would discard unpushed commits at session exit -- silently, since
 * nothing reads a hook's stdout on the remove path.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES DO INSTEAD, once the removal is done: run `scripts/prune-worktree-branches.mjs`,
 * which removes ABANDONED sibling checkouts -- registered, clean, unattended, on a branch whose work
 * is ALREADY IN `origin/main` -- deletes worktree branches whose work is already in `origin/main` and,
 * with each one, the `branch.<name>.remote` / `.merge` pair the agent's `git push -u` wrote to the
 * shared `.git/config`, as provisioning also did until it cut the branch with `--no-track`
 * (asdlc-openspec-686). The paragraph above is why that is a separate step rather than a line here: the
 * branch being torn down now is usually unmerged, so the sweep will keep it and collect the leavings
 * of EARLIER worktrees whose pull requests have since landed -- including checkouts no teardown ever
 * ran for, because this hook fires only when the harness removes a worktree and a background job
 * that simply ends leaves its checkout registered. Nothing is deleted without proof of containment,
 * so the distinction the paragraph above draws is preserved rather than traded away -- see that
 * script's header for the two proofs it accepts, the conditions a checkout must meet to count as
 * abandoned, and why a stale or missing `origin/main` can only make it more conservative. Without
 * this the two keys per worktree accumulate for the life of the repository; 222 of 241 local config
 * keys were `branch.agent/*` when it was added.
 *
 * Its report goes to STDERR, like every other message here. The harness reads this hook's stdout,
 * and worktree-hooks.selftest.mjs asserts it stays empty.
 *
 * CONTRACT (verified against the CLI, 2.1.241). stdin is JSON:
 *   { "hook_event_name": "WorktreeRemove", "worktree_path": "<absolute path>", ... }
 * Exit zero once the worktree is gone. The harness checks the path afterwards and warns
 * "WorktreeRemove hook did not remove worktree, kept at: ..." if it is still there, so a zero exit
 * over a failed removal buys nothing.

// NO `git worktree prune` HERE, and the incident that took it out. This hook ran one on `ROOT` on
// every call, before the ownership check, so each run of `worktree:selftest`, a pre-push job, pruned
// the real repository through that suite's foreign-path cases. On a host that took only records
// whose worktree was gone. On 2026-10-06 a dev container on the bind-mounted primary checkout pushed,
// and there every record names a host path the container cannot see: git read each as stale,
// pruned them all, and git and bd stopped working in every linked worktree on the host
// (asdlc-openspec-486e). The same suite's foreign path also named the admin directory of a live
// worktree that shared its last name, hence `owned` above. Pruning is the sweep's, by its rule.

/**
 * Whether the sweep may run at all, as a reason string, or `null` to proceed.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT THIS PREVENTS, and it is not hypothetical -- it happened during this hook's own
 * development. The sweep below mutates branches and `.git/config`, which are SHARED state, while
 * `worktree_path` is whatever the caller passed. `worktree-hooks.selftest.mjs` deliberately calls
 * this hook with a throwaway `/tmp` directory to exercise the sandbox-removal fallback, and the
 * sweep, keyed off `ROOT` rather than off that path, therefore ran against THE REAL REPOSITORY on
 * every invocation. `worktree:selftest` is a pre-push job, so that made an ordinary `git push` a
 * branch-deleting event; run against a copy of the script with its safety guards deliberately
 * mutated for a mutation test, it deleted 104 local branches. They were restored from
 * `worktree-gc.log`, which is exactly why that log exists.
 *
 * So the sweep runs only when the path removed is one this repository actually provisions -- inside
 * `<ROOT>/.claude/worktrees/`. A foreign path means this hook is being exercised rather than used,
 * and the correct response to a teardown of something we do not own is to touch nothing.
 * `WORKTREE_GC=0` is the second layer, for a caller that wants the removal without the sweep.
