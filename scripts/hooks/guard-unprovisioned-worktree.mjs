/**
 * PreToolUse hook on Bash. Refuses every command in a linked worktree whose branch is not
 * `agent/<name>`: a worktree the sanctioned provisioner, `scripts/new-worktree.sh`, did not make.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Worktrees live at `.claude/worktrees/<name>` -- the location the `EnterWorktree`
 * tool uses natively -- and `scripts/hooks/worktree-create.mjs` routes that tool through
 * `scripts/new-worktree.sh` so each one is cut from `origin/main` onto `agent/<name>` with a probed
 * port pair and a rendered briefing. Since the tool and the script now agree on WHERE, location
 * carries no information and this guard does not look at it.
 *
 * What the tool and the script still disagree about is everything the script does after choosing
 * the path. When the settings file a session loaded registers no WorktreeCreate hook, as in a
 * checkout whose `.claude/settings.json` predates it, `EnterWorktree` silently falls back to
 * its native behaviour: branch `worktree-<name>`, cut from whatever `worktree.baseRef` names
 * (`fresh`, the default, takes `origin/<default branch>`; `head` takes the local HEAD), and no
 * `.worktree/CONTEXT.md`, so the briefing CLAUDE.md @-imports is absent and the agent never reads
 * the rules of a shared repository. No `worktree.baseRef` value names `origin/main` itself: the
 * default branch is a GitHub setting outside this repository, `main` when checked on 2026-09-23,
 * which is the same reason `guard-git.mjs`'s PR-base rule will not infer it.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-08 (asdlc-openspec-gm86) this header, then `guard-git.mjs`'s, said Claude Code
 * snapshots hook configuration at session start, so that any session begun before the hook was
 * added fell back. It does not: a WorktreeCreate hook added to the settings file mid-session took
 * over `EnterWorktree` with no restart, and `.claude/README.md` § The hooks gives that test and the
 * version it ran on. The hooks documentation says such an edit is "normally" picked up, which
 * leaves an edit the file watcher missed as the other way a session can lack the hook.
 *
 * No incident here yet. Were this check wrong, it would let an agent do real work in a worktree with
 * no briefing, on a branch CLAUDE.md § Git workflow does not provide for, cut from a base no file in
 * this repository chose.
 *
 * A WorktreeCreate hook cannot cover this, because the failure is that no WorktreeCreate hook ran.
 * This one is a PreToolUse Bash hook, so it fires on the agent's first command whether or not the
 * session's settings register a WorktreeCreate hook -- the only place left to catch it.
 *
 * THE SIGNAL IS THE BRANCH NAME. `new-worktree.sh` always names the branch `agent/<name>`; the
 * native fallback always names it `worktree-<name>`. The base cannot be the signal: while the
 * default branch is `main`, a `fresh` fallback starts from the same `origin/main` the script does,
 * and the two differ at most by how recently it was fetched. The name is cheap, needs no network,
 * and does not move as `origin/main` does. The base distance is measured only to put a number in
 * the message when there is one, and never decides, because a legitimately long-lived `agent/*`
 * branch may sit far behind `origin/main` for good reasons.
 *
 * IT REFUSES EVERY COMMAND, NOT JUST GIT: the agent is about to do real work against a commit it did
 * not choose, and every command it runs deepens that. Escaping does not need the shell --
 * `ExitWorktree` is a tool -- so refusing every Bash command leaves a way out rather than a
 * deadlock. It reads no command, so an unreadable payload changes only where it looks: the
 * process's own directory, as below.
 *
 * WHERE THE COMMAND RUNS, AND THE GIT IT ASKS, are as `guard-git.mjs` reads them, for the reasons its
 * `commandDir` and `gitOut` give: the payload's `cwd`, never `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, which stays at the
 * primary checkout after `EnterWorktree`; and git with no inherited `GIT_*` variable (`gitEnv` in
 * `_shared.mjs`), which would point git at another checkout.
 *
 * A FILE OF ITS OWN, OFF THE HIGH-RISK FLOOR. Until 2026-10-08 this check lived in `guard-git.mjs`,
 * which the floor holds for its approval and merge rules (`prReviewHighRiskPaths` in
 * `tools/policy/pr-review.json`), so a change to this check alone waited for a person though it
 * decides nothing about an approval or a merge: pull request #181 changed only this check's reason
 * and message, and the reviewer held it for `guard-git.mjs`. Here a change to it merges as
 * `worktree-create.mjs`'s does (`docs/decisions.md` § D-58). Where that loses: a change that
 * weakens this check merges without a person, and `worktree:selftest` is what holds it. It costs one
 * more Node process and three git calls on every Bash command, beside the guard's: a median of 84 ms
 * against the guard's 69 ms, 20 runs each on a payload from an `agent/*` worktree, Node 24.21.0 on a
 * macOS laptop, 2026-10-08.
 *
 *   printf '%s' '{"cwd":"<a worktree>","tool_input":{"command":"ls"}}' | node scripts/hooks/guard-unprovisioned-worktree.mjs
 *
 * Exit 2 refuses, with the reason on stderr, as `guard-git.mjs` does; exit 0 allows. NEEDS git on
 * `PATH`. Where git cannot answer -- no repository, git missing, a detached HEAD -- it allows the
 * command. Run by hand with no payload on stdin, it exits 0 with nothing to judge.
