/**
 * Self-test for scripts/hooks/worktree-create.mjs, scripts/hooks/worktree-remove.mjs,
 * scripts/prune-worktree-branches.mjs, scripts/render-worktree-context.mjs with the briefing
 * template it renders, scripts/new-worktree.sh's choice of which copy of that template renders, its
 * copy of the primary checkout's Vale styles, its run beside another that holds `.git/config.lock`
 * and the branch a failed run of it made, and for the hook registrations in
 * .claude/settings.json: each must load
 * whatever the session's working directory is (the last section says what broke).
 *
 * Covers the halves of the contract that are cheap to exercise and easy to get wrong: what the hooks
 * accept on stdin, what they refuse, and -- for the remove hook -- that stdout stays clean and the
 * sandbox fallback actually deletes a directory `git worktree remove` will not touch. It deliberately
 * does NOT provision a real worktree: `git worktree add` needs the primary checkout, and a
 * worktree-isolated session is refused it by scripts/hooks/guard-git.mjs. That one round trip is
 * verified by running the create hook from the primary checkout; see the PR body. The new-worktree
 * case runs the script only in a scratch repository of its own.
 *
 * THE PRUNE CASES ARE DIFFERENT IN KIND from everything else here, and the difference is the point:
 * that script DELETES BRANCHES AND REMOVES CHECKOUTS, so what is asserted is not that it works but
 * that it refuses, in each of the ways it can be asked to do damage. Two rules follow from that and
 * both were learned the hard way. First, every refusal is asserted by the REASON reported, not by
 * mere survival -- the checked-out case passed with the guard deleted, because `git branch -D`
 * refuses a checked-out branch by itself, which made the check vacuous; `git worktree remove` refuses
 * a dirty or locked tree by itself in exactly the same way. Second, nothing in this file may run the
 * sweep against THIS repository: `worktree:selftest` is a pre-push job, and an earlier version of the
 * remove hook swept the real repo on every invocation, deleting 104 local branches. The scratch
 * repository below and the hook's own ownership check are what keep that separated.
 *
 *   node scripts/hooks/worktree-hooks.selftest.mjs
 *
 * Needs `git`, `bash` and a POSIX `sh` on PATH, and `/proc` or `lsof` for the prune sweep's
 * liveness case, which fails rather than skips on Linux and macOS without them. It reads nothing
 * outside the temporary directory
 * but this checkout's own files. The render and new-worktree cases bind loopback ports for a moment,
 * as the renderer's port probe does.

 * prune-worktree-branches: the safety rule.
 *
 * The script deletes branches and removes checkouts, so what has to be tested is not that it works
 * but that it REFUSES in each of the ways it can be asked to do damage. For branches: an unmerged
 * branch, a branch a kept worktree has checked out, and a branch that is not worktree-provisioned at
 * all. For worktrees, one case per condition of the abandonment proof: a dirty tree, a locked tree, a
 * tree whose branch is not in the trunk, a tree outside `.claude/worktrees/`, a tree with a process
 * inside it, a tree whose HEAD moved within `worktreeGcMinAgeHours`, and the tree the sweep itself
 * runs from. The positive cases -- a rebase-merged branch, a clean contained checkout nobody has used
 * for days, one its caller names as finished, and a registration whose directory is already gone --
 * are only interesting because they prove the negatives are not vacuous: a script that deleted
 * nothing would pass every refusal.
 *
 * The interesting positive is the REBASE-MERGED shape, which is what this repository's pull requests
 * actually leave behind: the branch is not an ancestor of the trunk, its commit SHA appears nowhere
 * on it, and only the patch-id matches. Built below with a cherry-pick, because that is exactly what
 * a rebase merge does to one commit.
 *
 * Every worktree below is cut from the trunk commit and so trivially contained. `abandoned` alone has
 * had HEAD still past the threshold; `between-calls` differs from it in that alone, and each other
 * refusal in one condition the sweep checks before the age, which is what lets a refusal be pinned
 * to its reason.

 * between reads as unmerged. Two proofs follow the ancestor proof: GitHub's record of a pull request
 * merged into the trunk's branch whose head is the branch's tip, read through `gh` -- a stub first on
 * PATH here, so no case reaches GitHub -- and, where that proves nothing, a patch-id of the changed
 * lines alone. Each positive has a negative beside it that differs in the one thing its proof reads.
 * A scratch repository of its own holds only these branches, since every run of the sweep walks
 * every worktree and branch there, and the one above has many by now.

 * render-worktree-context: the briefing a new worktree opens with.
 *
 * THE GAP (asdlc-openspec-pb2). This job's glob names the template and its renderer, and until
 * 2026-09-25 no case here read either, so a change to the template ran a selftest that passed without
 * looking at it. Two template changes were proved by a render run by hand into `.scratch/` instead:
 * asdlc-openspec-iy4's on 2026-09-23, and asdlc-openspec-zgh.6's port paragraphs on 2026-09-24.
 *
 * The renderer and the committed template are COPIED into a scratch checkout, because the renderer
 * finds the template beside itself and has no root override: run in place, a write relative to its own
 * checkout would land in this one. The copy runs from an empty directory, and every file under the
 * scratch root is listed afterwards, so a write anywhere but the path it was handed shows. The values
 * are hostile on purpose: `&` and `\` are what `sed` mangled (the renderer's header records `a&b`
 * rendering as `a{{WORKTREE_PATH}}b`), and `$&`, `$$` and `$1` are what `String.replace` expands when
 * it is handed a replacement string rather than a function.
 *
 * The control is the committed template, which must render clean. The negative is the same template
 * with a placeholder the renderer does not supply, which must be refused by its reason with nothing
 * written: without it, a renderer that lost its leftover check would still pass the control.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *
 * .claude/settings.json: every registered hook loads whatever the working directory is.
 *
 * THE INCIDENT (asdlc-openspec-7dj). Every hook was registered as `node scripts/hooks/<name>.mjs`,
 * a path relative to the directory the harness runs a hook in, which is the session's current one.
 * On 2026-09-25, after a Bash `cd docs`, the Stop hook failed with "Cannot find module
 * .../docs/scripts/hooks/gate-summary.mjs" and printed no verdict, and `guard-git.mjs` failed to
 * load the same way; its exit 1 does not block, so the next command ran unguarded. Each command now
 * names its script through `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (`.claude/README.md` § The hooks).
 *
 * Each registered command runs as the harness runs a command hook, through `sh -c` with
 * `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` naming this checkout, from a subdirectory of it (the incident's shape) and
 * from a directory outside it. The `node` first on PATH is a stand-in that reports the script it was
 * handed and runs nothing, because `worktree-create.mjs` provisions a real worktree when it runs. So
 * every command must be `node <script>`: that is what lets this case test one without running it.
 *
 * The control is the old relative form from the checkout root, which must load; the negative is the
 * same form from the subdirectory, which must be refused for that reason. Without the pair, a
 * stand-in that refused everything, or loaded everything, would pass every case below it.
