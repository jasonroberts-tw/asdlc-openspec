/**
 * WorktreeCreate hook. Makes the Claude Code `EnterWorktree` tool provision worktrees through
 * `scripts/new-worktree.sh` instead of creating its own.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS: two unrelated ways to get a worktree in one repository. What the harness
 * tool and the script disagree about, after the script was moved to the tool's own location:
 *
 *   |            | new-worktree.sh              | EnterWorktree, unhooked           |
 *   |------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
 *   | location   | .claude/worktrees/<name>     | .claude/worktrees/<name> -- AGREE |
 *   | base       | origin/main, the real trunk   | origin/<default branch> = main    |
 *   | branch     | agent/<name>                 | worktree-<name>                   |
 *   | ports      | probed, written to ports.env | none; every agent binds the same  |
 *   | briefing   | .worktree/CONTEXT.md         | none; CLAUDE.md's @-import is dead|
 *
 * LOCATION USED TO BE THE FIRST ROW AND IS NOW SETTLED. The script provisioned outside the working
 * tree at `../worktrees/<name>` and the tool insisted on `.claude/worktrees/<name>`, so the two
 * fought over every worktree; the repository now accepts the tool's location and the script follows
 * it. The hazard that argued for staying outside is real but is handled by a different mechanism: a
 * checkout inside the working tree carries its own `.git`, reads to the parent as a gitlink, and can
 * be committed as a phantom submodule by a sweeping `git add` -- which is what one commit did to both
 * trunks. `.gitignore` covers `.claude/worktrees/`, and that rule is what makes the shared location
 * safe. Two further benefits fell out of agreeing: `EnterWorktree` can switch into a worktree it
 * recognises, which it refuses for any path outside `.claude/worktrees/`, and there is no longer a
 * placement an agent can reach by accident.
 *
 * The base is now the whole argument for this hook, and it was always the worse half. CLAUDE.md is
 * emphatic that `main` is the trunk and that "tooling that guesses a trunk from the default branch is
 * guessing wrong here" -- and `worktree.baseRef` only offers `fresh` (origin/<default branch>) or
 * `head`, so no setting expresses "origin/main". A hook does. When this hook does NOT run, the
 * fallback is silent and the branch name is the only surviving evidence, which is what
 * `guard-git.mjs` keys its unprovisioned-worktree tripwire on.
 *
 * CONTRACT (verified against the CLI, 2.1.241). stdin is JSON:
 *   { "hook_event_name": "WorktreeCreate", "name": "<worktree name>", "cwd": ..., "session_id": ... }
 * The hook must CREATE the directory and print its path as the last line of stdout. Everything else
 * -- every diagnostic, every line new-worktree.sh prints -- must go to stderr, or the harness reads
 * it as the path. A configured hook takes precedence over the native git path even inside a git
 * repository, so this file is the only worktree provisioner once it is wired up.
