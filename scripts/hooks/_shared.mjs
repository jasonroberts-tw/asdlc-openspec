 * imports Node's built-in `fs`, `path`, `url` and `child_process` and nothing else, and it reads no
 * file and starts no process when it is loaded. Three helpers start a process, and only when called:
 * `runTask` runs a task, after importing `scripts/lib/tasks.mjs` to read the manifest; `checkoutOf`
 * runs git; and `editedCheckout` runs it through `checkoutOf`. A hook that calls none starts none.
 *
 * Why this tier exists: most of the work in this
 * repository is done by an agent, and a gate that fires after the agent has spent twenty minutes
 * going the wrong way is worth far less than one that stops it at the first keystroke.
