/**
 * PostToolUse hook. After a write to anything an EMITTER reads, re-check that the committed output
 * still matches what that emitter produces.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PREVENTS: editing an input and forgetting to re-run the emitter. The committed
 * output and its source then disagree, and nothing says so until CI -- by which point several more
 * changes are layered on top and the drift is no longer attributable to the edit that caused it.
 *
 * WAS `check-generator-drift.mjs`, and every trigger it had ran `generate:check`. That gate, and the
 * screen generator behind it, are deleted. What survives is the same defect against the emitters
 * that are still here: the catalogue emitter and its inputs, and the two hand-authored records the
 * learning loop reads. Other emitters had triggers here until the nodes behind them were retired,
 * and each row went in the same change as its emitter. The file was renamed rather than deleted
 * because the failure mode is a property of emitted output, not of the generator that happened to
 * be the first example of it.
 *
 * Only fires for the inputs listed in `TRIGGERS`. A write to a README or a story file cannot change
 * emitted output, and paying two seconds to prove that on every edit is how a hook gets turned off.
 *
 * Exit 2 surfaces the drift to the agent as feedback. The tool call has already run, so this blocks
 * nothing -- it just makes the consequence visible at the moment it is created.

 *
 * A ROW STOOD HERE for another emitter until a decision deleted it and froze its rendered output
 * under the retired directory; the shape it guarded -- an input edited and its emitter not
 * re-run -- is the catalogue's below.
 *
 * `catalogue:check` rebuilds the published skill tree in memory and diffs it. `catalogue/SKILL.md` is
 * the hand-authored source of the tree's `SKILL.md`, so an edit there that is not
 * followed by `npm run catalogue` is that defect exactly, 1.5s (`time npm run catalogue:check`,
