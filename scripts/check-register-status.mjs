/**
 * Register-status gate: the header of `docs/decisions.md` agrees with its body.
 *
 *   npm run check:register             the gate
 *   npm run check:register:selftest    its fixtures -- every assertion exercised on a doctored copy
 *
 * THE JOB THIS EXISTS FOR. A register's status line said "every decision from D-01 to D-22 is
 * recorded and applied" while ten more were recorded in the same file below it, and its
 * `## Decisions — recorded and applied` table stopped earlier still. Those ten were appended
 * without touching either: the convention that actually emerged was additive only. The line's own
 * blockquote had predicted it twice and named the mechanism that was supposed to stop it: the
 * range "is checked by reading the `### D-` headings below, which is the same act as adding one".
 * It was not the same act. Four more hand-maintained files restated the range at four different
 * stale values -- the multi-copy drift `count-index.md` exists to stop, for a figure that
 * deliberately gets no `CNT-*` key because it moves when somebody records a
 * decision, not when what you measure is re-measured.
 *
 * WHAT THE RECORD IS. The `### D-NN` headings -- EXACTLY three hashes. A level-two NARRATIVE
 * heading further down the file that opens with the same id is not a second entry: a gate keyed
 * on `^#{2,3} D-` reports a duplicate and is red on arrival. Do not widen the anchor to "tidy" it.
 * N is max(id), not the last heading, because a decision can be filed out of numeric order.
 *
 * WHAT FAILS THE JOB:
 *   1. no `### D-` heading at all, a duplicate id, or a gap (the ids must be exactly 1..N)
 *   2. the status line's `D-01 to D-NN` bound is not N -- or the line is gone
 *   3. the blockquote's `` `D-01 … D-NN` is checked by `` bound is not N -- or the sentence is gone
 *   4. the decisions table's `| **D-NN** |` id set differs from the heading set in either
 *      direction, or the table heading is gone
 *   5. a citing file that RESTATES the range carries a bound other than N, or stops carrying one; a
 *      citing file that cites the register WITHOUT a bound grows one, even at N; an allowlisted
 *      narrower range is no longer present (a stale allowlist entry is a hole in the gate)
 *   6. the status line's parenthetical -- `(D-09 added 2026-08-21; D-10 and D-11 added 2026-08-23;
 *      …)` -- dates a decision on a day other than the one its section's opening `**Recorded
 *      <date>` line carries, names an id with no heading or no Recorded line, or omits a decision
 *      that has one; or a decision from the first one that carries a Recorded line onward
 *      (derived, not hard-coded) has none. The dates were "copied from each section's Recorded
 *      line and not gated" until a fix-up corrected a swapped pair BY HAND -- exactly the drift
 *      an ungated hand-copied parenthetical produces, and exactly the shape items 2-5 exist for.
 *
 * An anchor that finds nothing FAILS. Update the prose from the headings, never the headings from the
 * prose, and never delete a line to silence this gate. The one exception to that direction is item
 * 6: a parenthetical date is corrected FROM the Recorded line, never the Recorded line from the
 * parenthetical -- the section is the record, the header summarises it.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CHECKED, deliberately: the Decision and Applied-as text of the table rows (they
 * paraphrase, so title equality would be red on arrival); the "All twelve tasks are complete" count
 * on the same line; the Recorded lines of the entries filed before the convention existed, which
 * have none (the rule is anchored on the first section that carries one rather than on a numeral);
 * and range mentions anywhere but the citing files -- a repository-wide regex was measured and
 * refused, because the legitimately narrower ranges elsewhere (a design note citing `D-01…D-15`,
 * say) are exactly what it would flag.
 *
 * NEGATIVE TESTING. `--selftest` copies the register and the citing files under `os.tmpdir()` and
 * doctors ONE thing per case, asserting the run fails FOR THAT REASON -- plus a control that the
 * undoctored copy passes, without which every other case could be failing on the copy. By hand,
 * point `CHECK_REGISTER_ROOT` at a copy of the tree, as `check-provenance.mjs` does:
 *
 *   CHECK_REGISTER_ROOT=/tmp/doctored node scripts/check-register-status.mjs
 *
 * Reads only committed files; no `../estate` checkout, no network, milliseconds.
