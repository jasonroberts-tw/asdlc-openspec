/**
 * The fast local version of the emitted-output checks, for a git pre-commit hook.
 *
 *   node scripts/assert-not-hand-edited.mjs <staged files...>
 *
 * It fails when a staged file is owned by a generator AND no longer matches what that generator
 * produces. The message names the manifest, the extraction document and the emitter, so the next move
 * is a redirect rather than a guess.
 *
 * WHY BOTH THIS AND CI. The `*:check` scripts are the authority and run in CI. They answer "do the
 * committed build products match their generators", which is the right question at merge time and
 * the wrong one at the moment of the mistake: by then the edit is one of several in the diff and the
 * failure names a file, not a reason. This runs on the staged paths only, at commit time, and answers
 * "you changed a build product, here is where the change belongs".
 *
 * ONE VERIFIER PER GENERATOR, CHOSEN BY PATH. An earlier version ran the screen generator's
 * `generate:check` no matter what was staged and exited 0 when it passed. That gate only ever compared
 * `src/screens/**`, so a hand edit to any OTHER build product -- the generated API client, the parsed
 * design tokens, the correction log -- was detected as suspect and then silently cleared by a check
 * that had never looked at it. Verifiers are now selected by the path that made the file suspect, and
 * a suspect nothing can verify is REPORTED as unverified rather than waved through.
