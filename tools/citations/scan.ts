/**
 * Cross-document citations, resolved against the documents they name.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. A citation written as `some-file.md:96` is a fact about another file that
 * nothing recomputes when that file changes. It rots silently and in the worst possible direction:
 * the pointer still LOOKS authoritative, so a reader who follows it and lands on unrelated prose
 * concludes they have misunderstood, not that the citation is wrong. The same is true of a citation
 * to a SECTION that does not exist.
 *
 * Both have bitten repeatedly, which is why this exists rather than a convention:
 *
 *   - `verify-layout.md:96`, cited by `tools/formhost/types.ts` and `tools/FormHostCapture/README.md`
 *     as the source of the capture-conditions set, resolved to a Playwright line. The text was at
 *     `:144`. `verify-layout.md:203`, cited by `claude-code-prompts.md`, resolved to a BLANK line;
 *     the text was at `:76`.
 *   - That same file had ZERO markdown headings while FIVE places cited a `§S-BASELINE` section of
 *     it. The anchor had never existed at any point in the file's life.
 *   - Roughly twenty `model.md:NN` citations into one document drifted twice; by the time a tracked issue was
 *     worked, 17 of the 18 distinct ones resolved to unrelated prose -- a horizontal rule, a blank
 *     line, the header row of the wrong table.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FLOOR, NOT THE CEILING. The strong form is a citation as a registered key whose value
 * is a distinctive PHRASE, so that the line is recomputed on every run and the passage is checked by
 * content. That is better and should keep spreading. But it only covers citations that have adopted
 * it, and a repository holds many that have not. This
 * takes citations exactly as they are WRITTEN, anywhere in the repository, and asserts the cheap
 * thing: that a reader following the pointer arrives somewhere real.
 *
 * So the two are complements, and the division is deliberate:
 *
 *   - adopted citation  -> `model-citations.ts`, checked by CONTENT, cannot drift at all
 *   - unadopted citation -> here, checked by RESOLUTION, catches the pointer that now lands on
 *     nothing, on a line past the end of the file, on a blank, or on a file that has since been
 *     RETIRED out from under its old name
 *
 * That last one was added after review, and it is the case where resolving too helpfully would have
 * been worse than not checking: retirement moves a file without rewriting the pointers into it, so
 * the basename fallback below finds the retired copy, checks the line inside it, and reports a
 * citation healthy that a reader following it as written cannot follow at all. See `RETIRED_ROOTS`.
 *
 * WHY IT SCANS EVERYTHING BY DEFAULT. `model-citations.selftest.ts` scans an allowlist of two
 * directories, and the history of that decision is the argument against copying it: its first
 * version covered ONE document, which left every citation into a sibling prompt exactly as exposed
 * as before -- and three had already drifted, one of them into a SHIPPED artifact, because no gate
 * could see them. An allowlist does not grow when the repository does. This scans every tracked text
 * file and takes exemptions one at a time, so a new citation is covered the day it is written and
 * every exemption is a line in a diff with a reason attached.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK.
 *
 *   - QUOTATIONS. A retest log quotes stale citations on purpose, and
 *     `docs/retired/` records what a retired document said (the correction log frozen there since
 *     a later decision records what a correction SAID at the time). CLAUDE.md exempts quotations from the count index for exactly
 *     this reason, and the same logic applies here: a gate that fails on the record of a past defect
 *     is a gate nobody can make green, so it gets deleted and checks nothing. See `HISTORY`.
 *   - WHETHER THE CITED LINE SAYS WHAT THE CITER CLAIMS. That needs a phrase, which is what
 *     `model-citations.ts` is. Resolution is the half that can be checked without one.
 *   - NUMERALS restated from another document. A prompt that repeats a corpus count it did not
 *     derive is a real and more expensive defect, but it needs a policy about prompt-embedded
 *     numerals rather than a scanner. Tracked separately.
 *   - BARE FILENAME MENTIONS -- a backticked `X.md` carrying no `:NN` and no `§`. `LINE_RE` and
 *     `SECTION_RE` below both require a locator, so a bare name is outside the definition of a
 *     citation used here. **That was measured and refused, not overlooked: see a later decision.** A tracked
 *     issue walked every one of them. A blanket rule produces 327 findings, of which the large
 *     majority are correct writing: shorthand for a path the document states once, deliberate
 *     mentions of files a later decision deleted (where the mention IS the record), and per-slice deliverables
 *     that `tools/pipeline/check.ts:139` already tolerates as "no slice is admitted yet". The
 *     narrow version -- a live file naming a RETIRED file by bare basename must spell the
 *     `docs/retired/` path -- flags 11, of which 10 are correct; one of those 10 is a frozen grep
 *     result its own document declares literal, so the rule would demand falsifying evidence.
 *     **Do not add either rule here.** The residue is real but semantic -- a bare name is a defect
 *     only when the passage presents the file as extant -- so a later decision makes it a review habit and
 *     names the one mechanical shape worth fixing on sight: a source attribution, "per `X.md`",
 *     with no locator.
 *
 * Reads only this repository, needs no `../sibling` checkout and no network.

/**
 * Whether any section of `lines` is named by `section`.
 *
 * NOT ATX-ONLY, and that matters here more than it would in most repositories: the prompt files use
 * bare uppercase labels as section markers. `archetype-classification.md` has no `#` heading in it
 * anywhere and its sections are lines reading `STALE WHEN` and `CONFIDENCE`; `DATABASE CHANGE
 * POLICY` in a second prompt is the same. A checker that recognised only `#` would
 * report every citation into those files as a dead section, which is a gate nobody could make green.
 * So a section is any line that BEGINS with the name -- heading or not.
 *
 * By PREFIX on the name, too, because prose runs straight on past the heading it names: "§
 * Measurement gives the failure condition for this node" cites a section called "Measurement".
 * Successive trailing words are dropped until something matches, so the assertion is the honest one:
 * does ANY leading part of what was written name a real section? A citation whose very first word
 * begins no line of the file is what this fails on, and that is the case that has actually bitten.
 *
 * The direction of the remaining error is deliberate. Matching any line, not just headings, lets a
 * table row or a body sentence satisfy a citation it was not meant to. That is a false PASS, and for
 * a floor gate a false pass costs a defect this run while a false FAIL costs the gate itself.
