/**
 * Memory citations: pointers into a store this repository does not use.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md § *Rules for agents live in tracked files, and nowhere else* gives every rule an agent
 * has to follow exactly one home, a tracked file, and names the two stores that are NOT it: the
 * `bd remember` / `bd recall` / `bd memories` store and the harness's per-project auto-memory
 * directory. A prompt that says "see memory `some-key`" or tells its reader to `bd recall` one
 * points at a store that is empty here by rule, and it fails in the worst direction: the pointer
 * reads as authoritative, so the reader concludes they lack access rather than that the sentence
 * beside it is the whole rule. One skill re-acquired such citations three reviews running, and the fourth
 * review found that none of the five keys it cited resolved. That is why this is a gate and not a
 * convention, and why it runs where `citations:check` already runs: a memory
 * key is a citation whose target cannot exist, which is the resolution gate's failure taken to its
 * limit.
 *
 * WHAT IS A FINDING. Two shapes, taken exactly as written:
 *
 *   - a backticked span preceded by the word `memory` -- `` memory `bd-deps-blocks-direction` ``,
 *     the spelling a prompt review used for every key it named, including the line-wrapped
 *     form where the word ends one line and the key opens the next (the review's `(memory` on one
 *     line and `` `bd-deps-blocks-direction` `` on the one below);
 *   - the tokens `bd recall`, `bd remember` and `bd memories`, backticked or bare.
 *
 * A paragraph break between the word and the span is NOT a match: `stays in memory` closing one
 * paragraph and a code span opening the next are two sentences, not a citation. `bd forget` is not
 * matched either -- the three tokens are the bead's and no review found a fourth; widen the list
 * when one appears, with the review that found it.
 *
 * WHERE IT LOOKS. The prompt homes that CLAUDE.md section names, and only those: `.claude/`,
 * a workflow's own directory once one exists, `.beads/formulas/`, `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`
 * (`MEMORY_SCOPE`) -- every tracked
 * file under them regardless of extension, because the formulas are `.toml` and the plugin's tools
 * carry their prompts in `.ps1` headers, neither of which `scan.ts`'s `SCANNED_EXTENSIONS` covers.
 * A roster rather than the whole tree, unlike `scan.ts`, on purpose: the word `memory` before a
 * code span is ordinary prose in a tool's comment and a defect only where an agent reads it as an
 * instruction, and a whole-tree scan would begin by exempting this file.
 *
 * WHAT IS EXEMPT, and the design problem it answers. CLAUDE.md names the forbidden commands twice:
 * once in the section that forbids them, and once in the `bd`-generated Beads block, which says
 * "Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge", is regenerated from the hash in its marker, and
 * cannot be edited (the section above it says so). Three ways to exempt those; this takes the third.
 *
 *   - NOT the whole of CLAUDE.md. It is the most-read prompt in the repository and the bead puts
 *     it in scope by name; exempting it wholesale is the hole dressed as an exemption every list in
 *     `scan.ts` warns about.
 *   - NOT a line that also carries a negation. That is a semantic rule: it passes the generated
 *     line for the wrong reason (its negation is about `MEMORY.md`, not about `bd remember`) and it
 *     passes "never skip `bd remember`" too.
 *   - TWO REGIONS OF CLAUDE.md, each keyed on its own delimiter (`MEMORY_EXEMPT_REGIONS`). The
 *     forbidding section by its `## ` heading text, from the heading to the next level-1 or level-2
 *     heading, on the argument `HISTORY` in `scan.ts` already makes for `tools/citations/`: it
 *     quotes the thing it exists to forbid. The generated block by `bd`'s own
 *     `<!-- BEGIN BEADS INTEGRATION` / `<!-- END BEADS INTEGRATION -->` markers, because those
 *     delimit exactly the region nobody can edit, and the headings inside them are `bd`'s to
 *     rename. A region applies to the one file it names, so the same heading in a skill exempts
 *     nothing and cannot be copied to route around the gate. And a registered region that is not
 *     found in its file is a FINDING, not a silent pass: rename the heading or lose the markers and
 *     the gate says so on the next run, rather than going quietly green over the whole file.
 *
 * NOTHING IS EXEMPT AS HISTORY. The rule once exempted `docs/prompt-reviews/`, whose reviews quoted
 * the memory keys a skill cited in order to record that none resolved. `docs/decisions.md` § D-05
 * deleted the directory, and the exemption went with it. Widen the roster to `docs/` and
 * `docs/retired/` needs one, on the argument `HISTORY` in `scan.ts` makes for it.
 *
 * Reads only this repository, needs no `../sibling` checkout and no network.
