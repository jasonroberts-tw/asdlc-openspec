/**
 * `npm run citations:check` -- does every `<file>.md:NN` and `` `<file>.md` § <Name> `` citation in
 * this repository resolve to what it names?
 *
 * `tools/citations/scan.ts` carries the reasoning: why this scans everything rather than an
 * allowlist, why quotations are exempt, and why it is the floor under `model-citations.ts` rather
 * than a replacement for it. This file is the gate over the real repository.
 *
 * FIVE FAILURES, all of them the silent kind.
 *
 *   1. The named file does not exist. It was moved or retired and the citation was left behind.
 *   2. The cited line is past the end of the file. The file shrank underneath the pointer.
 *   3. The cited line is BLANK. The file grew above the pointer and it slid off the passage -- the
 *      most common shape, and the one that reads as authoritative right up until you follow it.
 *   4. The cited SECTION does not exist. Either the heading was renamed, or -- the pathological
 *      version, which has happened -- the file has no headings at all and never did.
 *   5. The cited target is a MEMORY KEY, or the sentence tells its reader to `bd recall` one. The
 *      store is not used here (CLAUDE.md § *Rules for agents live in tracked files, and nowhere
 *      else*), so the pointer can never resolve. `tools/citations/memory.ts` carries the rule: its
 *      roster of prompt homes, and the two regions of CLAUDE.md -- the section that forbids the
 *      store and the `bd`-generated block nobody can edit -- exempt by heading and by marker rather
 *      than the file as a whole.
 *
 * Needs no `../estate` checkout and no network; it reads tracked files and runs in about a
 * second.
