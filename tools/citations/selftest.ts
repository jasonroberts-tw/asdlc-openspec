/**
 * `npm run citations:selftest` -- does the citation scanner still BITE?
 *
 * A resolution gate has one characteristic failure and it is not a false alarm: it is going quietly
 * green. Narrow the regex by a character, resolve a path one strategy too eagerly, or let the
 * section matcher accept any line at all, and `citations:check` prints the same reassuring summary
 * over a repository it is no longer checking. Nothing in the repository's own citations would say
 * so, because the gate passing IS the expected outcome.
 *
 * So this holds the scanner to synthetic fixtures where the answer is known: every failure it is
 * supposed to catch, and -- just as important -- every shape it must NOT report, because a gate that
 * cries wolf is deleted and then checks nothing at all. The repository-level assertion at the end is
 * the other half: the scan must still be finding citations to check.
 *
 * Needs no `../estate` checkout and no network.
