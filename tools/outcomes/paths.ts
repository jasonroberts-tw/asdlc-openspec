/**
 * Where the learning loop's inputs and outputs are, in a module with NO side effects.
 *
 * Every path the record writer, the report emitter, the filing step and their selftest share is
 * stated here once, repository-relative, so the four cannot disagree about where a record lives.
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT EXISTS TO PREVENT. On day one: a writer that writes records under one directory
 * and an emitter that reads another both succeed, the emitter over zero records, and "no records
 * yet" is a legal answer that nobody would question.
 *
 * ROOT OVERRIDE. `OUTCOMES_ROOT` names a doctored copy of the repository, so a by-hand run of any
 * of the four can be pointed at a fixture tree without editing it. Unset, the root is the nearest
 * directory above this file that holds a `package.json`.
 *
 * NEEDS. Nothing: it reads the file system only to find that `package.json`.
