/**
 * outcomes:record:selftest — the run-outcome record's validator and writer, held to the committed
 * fixtures and to one doctored copy per rule.
 *
 * WHAT IT HOLDS
 *   fixtures    one committed fixture per terminal path under `tools/outcomes/fixtures/`
 *               (complete, failed, blocked), each accepted by the validator as committed.
 *   validator   an unknown version refused by name and FIRST; one case per cross-field rule; a
 *               schema that outgrew its reader (an unknown keyword, a bumped version) refused.
 *   writer      validates before it writes and writes nothing on refusal; never drops or rewrites an
 *               entry an existing record carries, and accepts the same correction as an addition;
 *               refuses a commit no remote-tracking ref contains, asked of a real repository.
 *   the tie     the schema's intervention enum equals the exhaustive list in the workflow's policy file, where one is declared,
 *               wherever that file is present. A file that declares no `intervention` block skips the tie.
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT EXISTS TO PREVENT. On day one: a validator nobody has ever seen refuse anything.
 * Every rule in `record.ts` is a few lines a refactor can turn into a no-op, and a record gate that
 * accepts everything looks exactly like a repository whose records are all well formed.
 *
 * INVOCATION.  npm run outcomes:record:selftest
 * NEEDS.       only committed files, and git for the one case that asks it a real question (it
 *              skips clean, saying so, where git is absent).
