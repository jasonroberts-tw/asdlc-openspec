/**
 * outcomes — reads every run-outcome record under `artifacts/outcomes/records/`, validates it against
 * `<workflow-name>/run-outcome.schema.json`, normalises it to canonical bytes, and derives the learning loop's reports under
 * `artifacts/outcomes/` from the records and nothing else: what recurs, where runs disagree,
 * what they could not decide, what looks dead or blocked, and the proposal list.
 *
 * KIND         re-runs whole whenever a record, the schema, the policy file or this emitter moves.
 * INVARIANTS   never writes outside `artifacts/outcomes/`; never changes what a record says
 *              (normalising re-serialises it, key order and spacing only); never reads the tracker,
 *              the reference, the network or a clock; writes nothing at all while any record is
 *              refused.
 * RE-ENTRY     idempotent: the same records write the same bytes. `--check` re-derives in memory,
 *              diffs against the tree, prints each differing path on its own line, exits 1 on any
 *              difference or stale file, and writes nothing.
 * STALE WHEN   `artifacts/outcomes/records/**`, `<workflow-name>/run-outcome.schema.json`, `tools/outcomes/**`.
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT EXISTS TO PREVENT. On day one: a loop whose reports are written by hand after
 * reading a few records, which is a report of what its author remembered. Every figure here is
 * re-derived from every record on every run, the check twin makes a stale report a red gate, and an
 * EMPTY records directory is a legal state every report names, not an error and not a blank page.
 *
 * INVOCATION.  npm run outcomes          normalise the records, write the reports, remove stale files
 *              npm run outcomes:check    re-derive, diff, write nothing
 * NEEDS.       only committed files. `OUTCOMES_ROOT` points it at a doctored copy.
