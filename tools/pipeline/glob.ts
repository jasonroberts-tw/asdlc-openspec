/**
 * A deliberately small glob matcher, and the file walk that feeds it.
 *
 * `node:fs`'s own `globSync` would replace this file with one line, and it is NOT used here on
 * purpose. It landed in Node 22.0.0 behind an `ExperimentalWarning`, and this module backs a gate
 * that runs in `pre-push` on a maintainer's Node 26 and in CI on Node 22
 * (`.github/workflows/verify.yml` pins `node-version: '22'`). A staleness gate whose file set can
 * differ between those two runtimes is worse than no gate at all: it folds a different digest on CI
 * than on the machine that stamped the artifact, and every stamped node reports stale forever with
 * nothing in the diff to explain it. The matcher below has one behaviour, written down.
 *
 * The vocabulary is exactly what `tools/pipeline/graph.ts` declares and no more:
 *
 *   `**`  zero or more whole path segments
 *   `*`   zero or more characters WITHIN one segment -- never crosses a `/`
 *   `?`   exactly one character within one segment
 *
 * Everything else is a literal. No braces, no character classes, no negation. A manifest entry that
 * wants one of those is describing something it should be naming outright, and `pipeline:check`
 * fails an input glob that matches nothing -- so an unsupported construct surfaces as a red gate
 * rather than as a silently-empty input group.
