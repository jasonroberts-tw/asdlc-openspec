/**
 * Whether a verdict should FAIL the gate, as opposed to being reported.
 *
 * This gate is a RATCHET, in the sense `lint:ratchet` already uses in this repository: pre-existing
 * debt may improve and must never regress. Every category below but the last is reported loudly and
 * does not fail, and each exclusion is a decision rather than a softening.
 *
 *  - `'grows'` NODES NEVER FAIL. The single most important line in this file. A push blocked on
 *    "a node should be reconciled" is a push people send with `--no-verify`, and `lefthook.yml`
 *    is already explicit that a bypassed hook is worse than no hook. (`'never'` nodes -- delivered
 *    cuts -- were not assessed at all, until that node kind was retired and the value with it; the
 *    `staleness !== 'inputs'` test below is unchanged and now means `'grows'` alone.)
 *
 *  - AN UNSTAMPED ARTIFACT PREDATES THIS MECHANISM. It was built before anything wrote a provenance
 *    block, so there is no record of what it was justified against and this gate has nothing to
 *    compare. Failing on it would make every push red on the commit that introduces the feature,
 *    which is how a gate gets deleted. It becomes binding for that node the moment its emitter runs
 *    once -- and until then the report says so on every push.
 *
 *  - PIN-DRIFT IS NOT STALENESS AT ALL. The corpus is a deliberate snapshot pinned at one
 *    `../estate` commit; a working checkout moves past that pin the moment anyone pulls, and
 *    `layout-extraction.md` already says every downstream artifact is pinned to it. Nothing in this
 *    repository caused the move and no commit here repairs it -- moving the pin is a decision, taken
 *    through `corpus-regen`. Failing a push on it would block work that has nothing to do with the
 *    corpus, on a condition the pusher did not create. Reported, because it silently invalidates the
 *    three deep `--check`s; never failed.
 *
 *  - LEGACY-COMMIT DIVERGENCE, by contrast, DOES fail nothing here only because the two nodes that parse the sibling checkout
 *    cannot be fixed by any commit in this repository either -- their re-extraction needs a toolchain
 *    and 2-4 minutes. It is the loudest report this gate produces.
 *
 * What DOES fail: a node that carried a valid stamp and whose declared inputs have since moved. That
 * is a change someone made in this repository, to files this repository owns, and the fix is to
 * re-run one named command.
