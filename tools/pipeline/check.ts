 * `npm run pipeline:check` -- does `tools/pipeline/graph.ts` still describe this repository?
 *
 * The manifest is a hand-maintained record of a graph that moves. Every other consumer of it -- the
 * staleness gate, the generated mermaid block, and the `bd dep add` wiring that comes later -- is
 * only as good as the record, and the failure mode of a wrong record is the quiet one: an input
 * group that matches nothing folds to a constant digest and reports CURRENT forever.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. One hand-maintained record cited an artifact for three days after a
 * decision renamed it, and nothing in the repository reported the dead citation. An input glob matching zero files is exactly that shape, so it is an
 * ERROR here rather than a warning.
 *
 * This check runs no generator and needs no `../estate` checkout.
