/**
 * git-env.ts — a copy of this process's environment without any `GIT_*` key, for running git
 * against a tree other than this checkout; `gitIn`, which runs git in one tree with it; and
 * `SCRATCH_GIT_ENV`, the environment of a scratch repository a tool builds for itself.
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT EXISTS TO PREVENT. A hook git runs from a linked worktree inherits `GIT_DIR`, that
 * worktree's absolute git directory, and `GIT_DIR` outranks both `cwd` and `-C <dir>`. A tool that
 * builds a scratch repository and runs git in it from inside such a hook then reads or writes THIS
 * repository while claiming to read the scratch one. Agents push here from linked worktrees, and
 * `npm run gates` runs the pre-push hook there through `git hook run`, which exports the same.
 * Measured on Git 2.54.0 (Apple Git-157) on 2026-10-03, in scratch repositories, through classic
 * `.git/hooks` scripts and config-based `hook.<name>.command` entries alike, for pre-commit,
 * prepare-commit-msg, post-checkout, post-merge and pre-push:
 *   - from a linked worktree, top level or subdirectory, every one of them gets `GIT_DIR`
 *     (`<common>/.git/worktrees/<name>`), pre-commit and prepare-commit-msg also get an absolute
 *     `GIT_INDEX_FILE` (that directory's `index`), and in each hook `git -C <other>` and git run in
 *     `<other>` both answered for the worktree, not for `<other>`;
 *   - from the primary checkout, top level, subdirectory or `git -C`, none gets `GIT_DIR`,
 *     pre-commit and prepare-commit-msg get the relative `GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/index`, and git run
 *     elsewhere answered for where it ran; so did the post-checkout `git worktree add` runs in the
 *     new worktree;
 *   - no hook from either got `GIT_WORK_TREE`.
 * Every `GIT_*` key is dropped all the same, because an index named by an absolute path is as
 * wrong for a scratch repository as a git directory is, and a caller may set any of them. The
 * incident: on 2026-10-01 `code-graph:selftest`, run by the pre-push hook from a linked worktree,
 * committed its fixture onto the branch being pushed, because its git calls kept the hook's
 * `GIT_DIR`; commit 21e4a95 moved them onto `gitEnv()`. `citations:selftest` asserts that
 * `gitEnv()` leaks no `GIT_*` key.
 *
 * WHAT A RETIREMENT TOOK OUT. This function came from `tools/lib/sibling-root.ts`, which
 * `docs/decisions.md` § D-15 deleted with the pipeline graph: `resolveSiblingRoot` and
 * `primaryCheckout` found a sibling checkout beside the primary one, and nothing here reads one.
 * `tools/lib/estate-root.ts`, its copy from before a rename, went with it.
 *
 * WHAT A SECOND EMITTER BROUGHT IN. `gitIn`, `gitOk` and `SCRATCH_GIT_ENV` came from
 * `tools/trace/trace.ts` when `tools/coupling/coupling.ts` needed them too (asdlc-openspec-3oln,
 * 2026-10-02): imported from trace, they would have loaded trace's own imports on every coupling
 * run, and a retirement of trace would have taken coupling's git runner with it.
 *
 * INVOCATION. Imported, never run:
 * `import { gitEnv, gitIn, gitOk, SCRATCH_GIT_ENV, type Git } from '../lib/git-env.ts'`.
 * NEEDS. Nothing at load: it reads `process.env` and writes nothing. A function `gitIn` returns
 * needs git on the PATH when it is called.
