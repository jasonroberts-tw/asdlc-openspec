/**
 * Where `bd`, the issue tracker's CLI, is on THIS machine, and how to start it without a shell.
 *
 * TWO CALLERS spawn `bd` and each used to resolve it on its own: `scripts/check-beads.mjs` with
 * `execFileSync('bd', ...)` and a catch-all that turned every error into "bd is not installed", and
 * `tools/outcomes/propose.ts` with `spawnSync('bd', args, { shell: process.platform === 'win32' })`
 * and Node's DEP0190 warning on every run.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT. On native Windows `bd` is the npm package `@beads/bd`, and what
 * `where bd` finds is `%APPDATA%\npm\bd` -- a `#!/bin/sh` shim, beside `bd.cmd` and `bd.ps1`, all
 * wrapping `node %APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\@beads\bd\bin\bd.js`. Node's `execFile` without a shell
 * hands the name to CreateProcess, which runs neither a shell script nor a `.cmd`, so the spawn threw
 * ENOENT and the catch reported a FOUND `bd` as ABSENT: `beads:check`, the one pre-push gate that
 * reads the tracker, printed "skipped: bd export produced nothing here" and exited 0 while `bd export`
 * from the same shell wrote 107 issues (measured 2026-09-08). A gate that is green without having
 * looked is the mirror of the failure `check-beads.mjs`'s own header argues against, and nothing in
 * the output told the two apart.
 *
 * WHAT THIS RESOLVES, in PATH order, first hit wins:
 *
 *   win32     `bd.exe` in a PATH directory -> spawn it directly.
 *             `bd` or `bd.cmd` (an npm shim) with `node_modules/@beads/bd/bin/bd.js` beside it ->
 *             spawn `process.execPath` on that `bd.js`; verified 2026-09-08 that
 *             `node <npm prefix>/node_modules/@beads/bd/bin/bd.js --version` prints `bd version 1.2.2`.
 *             A shim with NO package beside it is FOUND BUT NOT RUNNABLE: CreateProcess cannot start
 *             it and this module will not reach for `shell: true` to try.
 *   elsewhere `bd` in a PATH directory -> spawn it directly (the `@beads/bd` install on Linux is a
 *             symlink to `bd.js` with a `#!/usr/bin/env node` line, which the kernel runs itself). A
 *             `bd` that is present but not executable is likewise found-not-runnable.
 *
 * TELLING "NOT INSTALLED" FROM "FAILED TO RUN" IS THE CONTRACT, not a nicety. `found: false` is the
 * only result a caller may skip on -- a fresh clone, CI, a machine with no tracker. Everything else
 * is evidence of a `bd` on this machine, and a caller that then cannot export from it has a failure to
 * report, never a skip. `runBd` therefore never throws: a spawn error (`ENOENT`, `EACCES`) comes back
 * as `error` with `status: null`, so the caller prints it instead of catching it away.
 *
 * NO `shell: true` ANYWHERE. Under `shell: true` Node concatenates the arguments into one command
 * line rather than escaping them (the DEP0190 deprecation), so a path with a space or a title with a
 * quote in it changes meaning. Every spawn here is `command` + `args[]`, and on win32 the command is
 * either a real `.exe` or `process.execPath`, both of which CreateProcess starts.
 *
 * `resolveBd()` takes the platform, the environment and the PATH delimiter as OPTIONS, defaulting to
 * the process's own, so `bd-launcher.selftest.ts` can walk the win32 branch on a Linux host with a
 * fixture directory in place of `%APPDATA%\npm`. Nothing here reads `../estate`.
