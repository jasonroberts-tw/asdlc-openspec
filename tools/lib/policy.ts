/**
 * policy.ts — the policy read whole: every record under `tools/policy/`, its constants merged into one
 * object, for every tool, gate and prompt that reads a constant of the workflow.
 *
 * The records split the constants by who reads them and who may change them
 * (`tools/policy/README.md`, `docs/decisions.md` § D-27). A reader asks for a key, never for a
 * record, so a key can move between records without one of its readers changing. The headers each
 * record carries (`HEADER_FIELDS`) describe that record and are left out of the merge.
 *
 * THE FAILURE IT EXISTS TO PREVENT. No incident yet: the loader came with the split. Were it wrong,
 * a key defined in two records would reach each reader as whichever record it read last, and two
 * gates would hold one constant to two values while each passed. Or a reader would see a moved key
 * as absent, and fall back to a default or skip a refusal with no reason given. So it refuses a key
 * that two records define, and a record that is not a JSON object, rather than merging past either.
 * `mise run check:policy` holds the records' shape; this holds only what every reader needs to read
 * them at all.
 *
 * INVOCATION.
 *
 *   import { readPolicy } from '../tools/lib/policy.ts'
 *                                       readPolicy(root): the merged constants of the records under root
 *   node tools/lib/policy.ts <key>... [--prefix <p>]...
 *                                       prints the named constants, and every constant whose key starts
 *                                       with a prefix (no `Means`), as one JSON object in the merged
 *                                       order, for a prompt or a workflow's command; refuses a key no
 *                                       record holds. `check:policy:selftest` holds what it prints and
 *                                       refuses.
 *   POLICY_ROOT=<dir> node tools/lib/policy.ts ...
 *                                       the same over a doctored copy
 *
 * NEEDS. The committed records, or a `git` function to read them at a commit (`readPolicyAt`). No
 * network. Side-effect free on import.
